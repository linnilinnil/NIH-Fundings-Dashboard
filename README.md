# NIH GRANTS & FUNDGINS DATA
(PIC16B Project - marlene, sharon, skylar, kara)

Inspired by the comments from [this NIH blog](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/01/18/inequalities-in-the-distribution-of-national-institutes-of-health-research-project-grant-funding/), we build a dashboard based on the NIH research project grants & fundings data to address some questions asked by health science researchers regarding the resource distribution.   

To run the dashboard, simply clone the main branch of this github repository and run the app.py file like you would run any python file. Install dependencies if needed.
